Dear Mister Gunn, 
This is my final project

The purpose of this program is to add daily sales into record (4 different type of products : rock, sand, pebbles, and gravel) in m^3 
and entering new workers as well as sort the list of workers based on your preference

Theoretically, all requirements are met and I use some additional knowledge that I learnt from the internet that helps me reaching the goal.
(especially the file handling functions and sort with lambda)

In case you are wondering, the username is  DanielD and the password is  MisterGunnisthebest.

You may have known that I tried to use one of my past projects but them I realize that it was written in C++(silly me), so the only thing I reused for this project is the idea
As you can see there is two additional files to the project, these are the provided samples if you dont want to input the data
Other than that, the program is pretty much self-explanatory.

Hope you will have a great summer after this, and don't forget to stay strong and happy like you have always been!
Your dearest student (:^),
Daniel
